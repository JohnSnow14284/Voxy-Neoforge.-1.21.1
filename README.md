# Voxy NeoForge 1.21.1

**Voxy** is a Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering mod for Minecraft that extends your view distance far beyond vanilla limits.

This is an **unofficial NeoForge port** of the [original Voxy mod](https://github.com/MCRcortex/voxy) (Fabric) for Minecraft 1.21.1.

## Status

**Alpha** - Functional with known limitations.

### Working Features
- LOD terrain rendering beyond vanilla render distance
- Smooth transitions between LOD and vanilla chunks
- Fog integration (disabled at LOD boundaries)
- Block model baking for all render types (solid, cutout, cutout_mipped, translucent)
- Delayed chunk unloading to prevent pop-out effects

### Current Limitations
- Requires Sodium 0.6.13+ (NeoForge version)
- Some optional integrations not yet ported (Iris, Nvidium, Vivecraft)
- Debug screen integration disabled (MC 1.21.1 API changes)
